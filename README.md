# AI-Custom-Tetris

After signing up (or logging in), you will find yourself on a settings page. Here you can edit the pieces that you will play with and change the board size. Further you can have 3 different combinations of these stored for your account that you can play with at any time. To play, open the side bar by hovering the mouse over it, and then press Player VS AI, which will then start up a game with the player on
the right, and the AI on the left, get a higher score than the AI to win.

*Note: the reason a sidebar is used instead of a simple button in the bottom right, is because there were plans to add a competitive leaderboard, multiplayer, and the ability to have statistics about your gameplay displayed for you aswell. This however is now on hold as the project is currently being converted over to use React and express to have cleaner code for the navigation, and in the process clean up the inline styling present in the index.html.*
